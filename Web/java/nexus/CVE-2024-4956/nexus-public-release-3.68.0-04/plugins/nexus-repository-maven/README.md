    "versionPolicy" : "SNAPSHOT",
    "checksumPolicy" : "WARN",
    "strictContentTypeValidation" : false
  },
  "storage" : {
    "writePolicy" : "ALLOW"
  }
}
```

Use this config to create Maven proxy repository, use name `maven2-proxy` (or as you wish, but update accordingly the group configuration below):
```
{
  "maven" : {
    "versionPolicy" : "MIXED",
    "checksumPolicy" : "WARN",
    "strictContentTypeValidation" : false
  },
  "proxy" : {
    "remoteUrl" : "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/",
    "contentMaxAge" : 3600
  },
  "httpclient" : {
    "connection" : {
      "timeout" : 1500,
      "retries" : 3
    },
    "authentication" : {
        "type" : "username",

    }
  },
  "storage" : {

```
{
  "maven" : {
    "versionPolicy" : "MIXED",
    "checksumPolicy" : "WARN",
    "strictContentTypeValidation" : false
  },
  "group" : {
    "memberNames" : ["maven2-hosted", "maven2-proxy"]
  },
  "storage" : {

## Building Maven master branch and deploying it to NX3 itself

* create "maven2-hosted" repository with snippet above (to host mavan snapshot deploy)
* create "maven2-proxy" repository with snippet above to proxy Central
* create "maven2-group" repository with snippet above to group the two
* check out Apache Maven (or you can use any other prj that will have satisfied dependencies): https://github.com/apache/maven
* prepare environment, by putting this settings.xml below in project root directory (note: license header is a MUST due to eager RAT plugin, or use '-Drat.ignoreErrors=true')

* kick off a build and deploy:
```
mvn -s settings.xml clean deploy -Dtest=void -DfailIfNoTests=false -DaltDeploymentRepository=local-nexus-admin::default::http://localhost:8081/repository/maven2-hosted/ -U
```
Note: the `-U` is needed only to ensure Maven goes remote always (to recover from cached 404), if local repo empty as in "first run", it may be omitted.
