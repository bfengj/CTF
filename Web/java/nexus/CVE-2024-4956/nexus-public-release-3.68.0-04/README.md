## Build Requirements

Builds use Apache Maven and require Java 8. Apache Maven wrapper scripts are included in the source tree.

All release versioned dependencies should be available from the [Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/) repository.

For SNAPSHOT sources, SNAPSHOT versioned dependencies may only be available from https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid repository.

### Configuring Maven for SNAPSHOT Dependencies

Following best practices, the nexus-public POM does not include any root `<repositories>` elements.
    
Instead you are advised to [configure Apache Maven to point at single repository mirror URL](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html#using-a-single-repository) that is a group repository containing both Central proxy repository with Release version policy and sonatype-public-grid with a SNAPSHOT version policy. You can use a [repository manager](https://www.sonatype.org/nexus/go/) to set up a group repository that contains both of these remotes.

Alternately, [add a custom profile to a settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html) for repository manager development that includes both repositories.

## Building From Source

Released versions are tagged and branched using a name of the form `release-{version}`. For example: `release-3.29.2-02`

To build a tagged release, first fetch all tags:

```shell
git fetch --tags
```

Then checkout the remote branch you want. For example:

```shell
git checkout -b release-3.29.2-02 origin/release-3.29.2-02 --
```

Then build using the included Maven wrapper script. For example:

```shell
./mvnw clean install
```

For building SNAPSHOT versions, follow the same process, except your build may require access to [Sonatype Public Grid](https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid) to successfully resolve dependencies.

## Running

To run Nexus Repository, after building, unzip the assembly and start the server:

    unzip -d target assemblies/nexus-base-template/target/nexus-base-template-*.zip
    ./target/nexus-base-template-*/bin/nexus console

The `nexus-base-template` assembly is used as the basis for the official Sonatype Nexus Repository distributions.
