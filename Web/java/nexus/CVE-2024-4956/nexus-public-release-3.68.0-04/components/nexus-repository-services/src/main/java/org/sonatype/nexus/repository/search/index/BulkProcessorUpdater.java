/**
 * A Runnable for adding an {@link org.elasticsearch.action.index.IndexRequest}
 * or {@link org.elasticsearch.action.delete.DeleteRequest} to a {@link BulkProcessor}.
 *
 * The intention is for this Runnable to be run on a single dedicated worker thread so that only that thread
 * is contesting for the BulkProcessor's MutEx when {@link BulkProcessor#add(ActionRequest)} is invoked.
 * That worker thread should be the same worker thread running instances of {@link BulkProcessorFlusher}.
 * This is achieved by using a single thread pool in {@link ElasticSearchIndexServiceImpl} to run instances of
 * this Runnable which are created in {@link ElasticSearchIndexServiceImpl}.
