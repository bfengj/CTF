 * A Runnable for flushing a {@link BulkProcessor}.

 * The intention is for this Runnable to be run on a single dedicated worker thread so that only that thread
 * is contesting for the BulkProcessor's MutEx when {@link BulkProcessor#flush()} is invoked.
 * That worker thread should be the same worker thread running instances of {@link BulkProcessorUpdater}.
 * This is achieved by using a single thread pool in {@link ElasticSearchIndexServiceImpl} to run instances of
 * this Runnable which are created in {@link ElasticSearchIndexServiceImpl}.
